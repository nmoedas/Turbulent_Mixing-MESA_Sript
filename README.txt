This code is a Fortran implementation of turbulent mixing in MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). It is divided into two script files one is Dturb_script.f and inlist_Dturb.f. The Dturb_script.f contains the functions and calculations of this process that should be implemented in the run_star_extras.f of MESA. TheÂ  inlist_Dturb.f contains the set of configurations for the turbulent mixing that should be implemented in the inlists of used to initialise MESA.
