#This code is a Fortran implementation of turbulent mixing in MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). It is divided into one script file ''Dturb_script.f''. The Dturb_script.f contains the functions and calculations of this process that should be implemented in the run_star_extras.f of MESA.
