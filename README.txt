#This code is a Fortran implementation of turbulent mixing in MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, mesa-r12778; may need modifications for other versions). It is divided into a script file ''Dturb_script.f''. The Dturb_script.f contains the functions and calculations of this process that should be implemented in MESA's run_star_extras.f.
